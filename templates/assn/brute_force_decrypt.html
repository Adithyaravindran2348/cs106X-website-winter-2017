<h2 id="description">Problem Description:</h2>

<p>
	In Assignment 2, you wrote an encryption program that used the Transposition Cipher to encrypt and decrypt
        text based on a key. The field of <i>cryptanalysis</i> focuses on breaking codes that
        have been encoded in a particular way, and there have been many stories of the importance of codebreaking
        throughout history. In particular, British codebreakers located at Bletchley Park in England were 
        successful in breaking the German Enigma code through the use of a computer (one of the very first!) to brute-force
        solutions based on information about how the code was generated. The leader of this
        codebreaking group, Alan Turing, was one of the most famous computer scientists in the world,
        and his story has been told in a number of books and films, most recently in the film,
        <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_imitation_game"><i>The Imitation Game</i>, staring Benedict Cumberbatch</a>.
</p>
<p>
        For this assignment, you will modify your program from that assignment to include
        an option to attempt brute-force-decryption <i>without knowing the key!</i>
	We provide you with starter code in <span class="filename">transposition_decryption.cpp</span> 
        that provides a couple of constants and a function prototype called <code>bruteForce()</code>.
        You should copy and paste your entire program from Assignment 2 into the starter code, and then
        add one more option, as follows:
<pre class="cpp">
3) brute force decrypt without the key
</pre>
</p>
<p>
        Using this option, you need to implement the code to perform the decryption.
        We will give you some guidance about the method to perform the decryption, but you will
        have to figure out the details.
</p>
<p>
        Recall from the previous assignment that the transposition cipher scrambles
        the plaintext by first fitting the text into rows based on the key length, and then
        peeling off the <i>columns</i>, based on the alphabetization of the key.
        As long as the key isn't too long (we are limiting it to nine characters),
        it is possible to create a list of all possible alphabetizations of a string
        of characters as long as the potential keys, and then checking the decryption of 
        each potential key to see if it created a plausible plaintext.
</p>
<p>
        You might think that you have to check each potential key lengths up to nine
        (the maximum key length we will be checking), but because the key must evenly
        divide into the ciphertext length, you only need to check key lengths that
        fall into that criteria.
</p>
<p>
        You also might think that you will have to check a very large number of
        keys, because there are 26 letters in the alphabet, plus there are 
        upper- and lowercase letters, plus there are other characters, etc. However,
        there are many fewer possible ways to alphabetize any set of characters. For
        example, the words "secret" and "SECRET" both produce the same alphabetization
        for their characters. But, so do "pedler", "scales", "teapot", "hedges", and
        "medley". In other words, you simply need to look at the permutation of
        a unique set of letters, and you will (by definition) get all of the possible
        alphabetizations. Our suggestion is that you use the string "abc...i" for
        the possible set of letters, and simply find a permutation of those letters.
        For example, for the letters "abc", all of the possible alphabetizations
        for <i>any</i> three letter key 
        are "abc", "acb", "bac", "bca", "cab", and "cba".
</p>
<p>
        In order to determine if a plaintext is plausible, you can assume that it
        was written in English, and you should check each word in the decryption to see
        if it is in the English dictionary (which is provided in the starter code).
        Because there could be multiple possible decryptions, you are required to
        print out the <strong>top five</strong> plaintext solutions, with the
        percentage of words in each sentence that are in English. For instance,
        if a decryption produced a sentence that had 8/10 words in the dictionary,
        you would report that this was an 80% match (see the example output and
        match the style presented).
<p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation Details:</h2>

<p>
	You must implement the following function to complete the decryption:
	You must write the function with <u>exactly</u> the header shown here,
	but it is fine to have "helper functions" as needed.
<pre class="cpp">
Vector&lt;DecryptionGuess&gt; bruteForce(string ciphertext);
</pre>
<p>
The <code>DectyptionGuess</code> struct is defined as follows:
</p>
<pre class="cpp">
struct DecryptionGuess {
    string potentialPlaintext;
    double wordPercentage;
};
</pre>
<p>
The "topX" parameter refers to the top five guesses that you should return.
<i>Do not</i> hardcode this value -- there is a TOP_X constant that
defines how many guesses to return. You should make your function
generic enough so that it can return any number of guesses.
</p>
<p>
You will have to do some sorting of your results to return the top five
results. You <b>must</b> write any sorting code yourself (i.e., you cannot
use a C++ built-in sort function, or a data structure that sorts values for
you). See the <a href="#suggestions">hints section</a> below for an idea of
how to do this.
</p>
<p>
When you are checking the words that appear in your possible plaintext,
you should ignore all punctuation. The easiest way to do this is to walk
through each character in your plaintext, and use the <code>isalpha(char)</code>
function to determine if a character is a letter. Then, use the <code>isspace(char)</code>
function to determine if a character is a space (it also returns true for newlines and tabs).
Convert all space charcters into a literal space <code>(' ')</code>. Finally,
ignore all other characters that aren't alphabetic or spaces.
</p>
<h2 id="suggestions">Hints and Suggestions:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Make sure to leverage the code you already have!</b> You already 
        have a <code>string decrypt(string ciphertext, string key);</code> function
        from assignment 2: use it! Don't re-invent the wheel: focus on
        calling that function for all permutations, and analyzing the results.</li>
    <li>Finding word permutations is a recursive function. You could try calling
        your <code>decrypt()</code> function from within the recursive function,
        but it is probably better to simply have the recursive function return
        a vector of possible permutations, and then use that vector to do the
        test decryptions.</li>
    <li>Don't overthink the sorting problem. A simple insertion sort on a Vector
        takes about five to seven lines of code: find the position where the value
        should go, and insert it there using the Vector's <code>insert</code> function.
        If you start with an empty Vector, it is (by definition) already sorted,
        and this assumption makes writing the insertion code very simple.
        Also, because you know you have a limit to how many results you need to
        print out (the TOP_X constant), you don't need to store all decryptions:
        if you decrypt a phrase and it does not make it into the TOP_X number
        so far, it never will, so you can discard it.</li>
    <li>Use a Lexicon to hold the dictionary, and simply check to see if each
        word in your decrypted phrase is in the dictionary. We suggest that you
        write a function to strip out non-alpha and non-spaces (see above) with
        the function signature <code>string alphaAndSpaceOnly(string plaintext)</code>.</li> 
</ul> 

<h2 id="style">Style Details:</h2>

<p>
	As in other assignments, you should follow our <a class="popup" href="../../styleguide.shtml"><strong>Style Guide</strong></a> for information about expected coding style.
	You are also expected to follow all of the general style constraints emphasized in the Homework 1-3 specs, such as the ones about good problem decomposition, parameters, using proper C++ idioms, and commenting.
	The following are additional points of emphasis and style contraints specific to this problem:
</p>

<p>
	<em>Recursion and backtracking:</em>
	Part of your grade will come from appropriately utilizing recursive backtracking to implement your word-finding algorithm as described previously.
	We will also grade on the elegance of your recursive algorithm; don't create special cases in your recursive code if they are not necessary.
	Avoid <strong>"arm's length" recursion</strong>, which is where the true base case is not found and unnecessary code/logic is stuck into the recursive case.
	Efficiency of your recursive backtracking algorithms, such as avoiding dead-end searches by pruning, is very important.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Redundancy</strong> in recursive code is another major grading focus; avoid repeated logic as much as possible.
	As mentioned previously, it is fine (sometimes necessary) to use "helper" functions to assist you in implementing the recursive algorithms for any part of the assignment.
</p>

<p>
	<em>Variables:</em>
	While this constraint is not new to this assignment, we want to stress that you should not make any <strong>global variables</strong> or <strong>static variables</strong> (unless they are constants declared with the <code>const</code> keyword).
	Do not use globals as a way of getting around proper recursion and parameter-passing on this assignment.
</p>

<p>
	<em>Loops/Collections:</em>
	Loops and collections *are* allowed on this problem.
	But your fundamental algorithm must be recursive and not based on looping to perform the entire word search.
	You must use recursion to handle the self-similar aspects of the problem.
</p>

<p>
	<em>Commenting:</em>
	Of course you should have a comment header at the top of your code file and on top of each function.
	But we want to remind you that you should also have <strong>inline comments</strong> inside functions to explain complex sections of the code.
	Don't forget to place descriptive inline comments as needed on any complex code in the bodies to describe nontrivial parts of your algorithms.
</p>


<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ):</h2>

<p>
	For each assignment problem, we receive various frequent student questions.
	The answers to some of those questions can be found by clicking the link below.

</div>


<h2 id="extrafeatures">Possible Extra Features:</h2>

<p>
	Here are some ideas for extra features that you could add to your program:
</p>

<ul class="extrafeatureslist">
    <li><strong>(easy) Write out a list of what key could have been used</strong> Your program
    from assignment 2 already knows how to find the alphabetization of a word. If you find a key
    that decrypts the ciphertext, you can alphabetize all the words in the dictionary, and any
    that have the same alphabetization will be able to decrypt the ciphertext, too!</li>
    <li><strong>(medium) Figure out how to leverage the frequency of letters that come
            next to each other.</strong> Because there aren't any substitutions in a transposition cipher, all
    of the letters in the ciphertext appear in the plaintext, in a different order. A simple
    frequency analysis won't work for this case. However, if you can re-arrange the letters
    so that you can get partial words (e.g., "th" appears a lot in English text), you may be
    able to use that information to fix certain columns, speeding up the decryption.</li>
    <li><strong>(hard) Figure out a different scheme for decrypting that will
            work for long keys.</strong> The problem with our method is that once you get above 9 letter keys, 
    the number of alphabetic permutations gets too big to work efficiently. However, there are
    mathematical methods that might help break the problem down into smaller pieces that will
    allow for efficient decryption.</li> 
	<li>
		<strong>Other:</strong>
		If you have your own creative idea for an extra feature, ask your SL and/or the instructor about it.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	<em>Indicating that you have done extra features:</em>
	If you complete any extra features, then in the comment heading on the top of your program, please list all extra features that you worked on and where in the code they can be found (what functions, lines, etc. so that the grader can look at their code easily).
</p>

<p>
	<em>Submitting a program with extra features:</em>
	Since we use automated testing for part of our grading process, it is important that you submit a program that conforms to the preceding spec, even if you want to do extra features.
	If your feature(s) cause your program to change the output that it produces in such a way that it no longer matches the expected sample output test cases provided, you should submit two versions of your program file:
	a first one with the standard file name without any extra features added (or with all necessary features disabled or commented out), and a second one whose file name has the suffix <span class="filename">-extra.cpp</span> with the extra features enabled.
	Please distinguish them in by explaining which is which in the comment header.
	Our turnin system saves every submission you make, so if you make multiple submissions we will be able to view all of them; your previously submitted files will not be lost or overwritten.
