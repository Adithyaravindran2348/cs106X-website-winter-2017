	This problem focuses on implementing a heap, although you have a choice on the
        <i>type of heap</i> that you implement.
</p>

<p class="pairprogrammingno">
        The problem demonstrates the modularity and nature of Abstract Data Types: you
        are responsible for replacing all public functionality of the PatientQueue class 
        from part A with a heap structure. In other words, the patientqueueheap.h header
        file will have <strong>exactly</strong> the same public declaration as
        patientqueue.h from part A, but patientqueueheap.cpp will be implemented
        with a Heap instead of a Linked List. The private section of your patientqueueHeap.h
        file should be modified to comply with your heap class variables, functions, etc.
        In other words, you are making a drop-in replacement for the PatientQueue class,
        which should be faster than the Linked List implementation.
	This is an <strong>individual assignment</strong>.
	Write your own solution and do not work in a pair/group on this program.

<h2 id="description">Problem Description:</h2>
This problem is identical to the Patient Queue from part A of this assignment.

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation Details:</h2>
You may choose to implement any of the following heaps to create your PatientQueueHeap.
<p>
We will go over the binary heap in lecture, but if you decide to implement a different
type of heap, you will be responsible for researching how the data structure works.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Note: In your investigation, you may find that others have implemented the
    particular heap you have chosen in code (C++ or another language). You are not
    permitted to look at the code to implement your solution -- you must use
    descriptions and pseudo-code only.</strong> There is a somewhat fine line between
    using actual code and pseudocode, but you can consider pseudo-code to be a
    description of the algorithm. If you have any concerns, please reach out to either
    Chris, Aaron, or your Section Leader for clarification.
</p>

The heaps you may choose from are roughly ranked from easy to hard below:
<ul>
    <li>Binary Heap (as described in lecture): <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap</a>.</li>
    <li>Binomial Heap: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_heap">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_heap</a></li>
    <li>2-3 Heap: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2–3_heap">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2–3_heap</a></li>
    <li>Fibonacci Heap: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_heap">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_heap</a></li>
    <li>Leftist Tree: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leftist_tree">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leftist_tree</a></li>
    <li>Other: see below</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Heaps_(data_structures)">many other types of heaps</a>
you could build. If you would like to choose a different type of heap, you must schedule an appointment with Chris
to discuss it -- we will look at the data structure and see if it is appropriate for the assignment. 

<h3 id="patientqueue">PatientQueue Operations:</h3>

<p>
	As with Part A, your class must support all of the following operations.
        Note that the Big O column is not filled in: part of the assignment involves annotating all of your functions
        (in a function comment) with the Big O for each function.
</p>

<table class="methodtable">
	<tr>
		<th>Member Name</th>
		<th>Description</th>
		<th>Big-Oh</th>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td><code>PatientQueue()</code></td>
		<td>In this parameterless constructor you should initialize a new empty queue (with a null front for your internal linked list).</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td><code>~PatientQueue()</code></td>
		<td>In this destructor you must free up any memory used by your linked list nodes.</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td><code><var>pq</var>.newPatient(<var>name</var>, <var>priority</var>);</code></td>
		<td>
			In this function you should add the given person into your patient queue with the given priority.
			Duplicate names and priorities are allowed.
			Any string is a legal value, and any integer is a legal priority; there are no invalid values that can be passed.
		</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td><code><var>pq</var>.processPatient()</code></td>
		<td>
			In this function you should remove the patient with the most urgent priority from your queue, and you should also return their name as a string.
			You should throw a string <strong>exception</strong> if the queue does not contain any patients.
		</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td><code><var>pq</var>.frontName()</code></td>
		<td>
			In this function you should return the name of the most urgent patient (the person in the front of your patient queue),
			without removing it or altering the state of the queue.
			You should throw a string <strong>exception</strong> if the queue does not contain any patients.
		</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td><code><var>pq</var>.frontPriority()</code></td>
		<td>
			In this function you should return the integer priority of the most urgent patient (the person in the front of your patient queue),
			without removing it or altering the state of the queue.
			You should throw a string <strong>exception</strong> if the queue does not contain any patients.
		</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td><code><var>pq</var>.upgradePatient(<var>name</var>, <var>newPriority</var>);</code></td>
		<td>
			In this function you will modify the priority of a given existing patient in the queue.
			The intent is to change the patient's priority to be more urgent (a smaller integer) than its current value, perhaps because the patient's condition has gotten worse.
			If the given patient is present in the queue and already has a more urgent priority than the given new priority, or if the given patient is not already in the queue, your function should throw a string <strong>exception</strong>.
			If the given patient name occurs multiple times in the queue, you should alter the priority of the first occurrence you find when searching your linked list from the start.
		</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td><code><var>pq</var>.isEmpty()</code></td>
		<td>
			In this function you should return <code>true</code> if your patient queue does not contain any elements and <code>false</code> if it does contain at least one patient.
		</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td><code><var>pq</var>.clear();</code></td>
		<td>In this function you should remove all elements from the patient queue, freeing memory for all nodes that are removed.</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td><code><var>ostream</var> &lt;&lt; <var>pq</var></code></td>
		<td>
			You should write a <code>&lt;&lt;</code> operator for printing your patient queue to the console.
			The elements should be printed out in front-to-back order and must be in the form of <em>value</em>:<em>priority</em> with <code>{}</code> braces and separated by a comma and space, such as:
			<code>{2:Ford, 4:Bernard, 5:Dolores, 5:William, 5:Teddy, 8:Arnold}</code>
			The <code>PatientNode</code> structure has a <code>&lt;&lt;</code> operator that may be useful to you.
			Your formatting and spacing should match exactly.
			Do not place a <code>\n</code> or <code>endl</code> at the end of your output.
		</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<div class="caption">members you must write in <code>PatientQueue</code> class</div>

<p>
	The headers of every member must match those specified above.
	Do not change the parameters or function names.
</p>

<p>
	<em>Constructor/destructor:</em>
	Your class must define a parameterless constructor.
	Since your implementation allocates dynamic memory (using <code>new</code>), you must ensure that there are no memory leaks by freeing any such allocated memory at the appropriate time.
	This will mean that you will need a destructor to free the memory for all of your nodes.
</p>

<p>
	<em>Helper functions:</em>
	The members listed on the previous page represent your class's required behavior.
	But you may add other member functions to help you implement all of the appropriate behavior.
	Any other member functions you provide must be <code>private</code>.
	Remember that each member function of your class should have a clear, coherent purpose.
	You should provide private helper members for common repeated operations.
</p>

<p>
	You will also need to do the following:
</p>


<p>
	<strong>Add descriptive comments to <span class="filename">PatientQueue.h/cpp</span>.</strong>
        One comment for each file should be <strong>the Big O for that function</strong>.
	Both files should have top-of-file headers; one file should have header comments atop each member function, either the .h or .cpp; and the .cpp should have internal comments describing the details of each function's implementation.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Declare your necessary private member variable in <span class="filename">PatientQueue.h</span>, along with any private member functions you want to help you implement the required public behavior.</strong>
	Your inner data storage <em>must</em> be a singly linked list of patient nodes; do not use any other collections or data structures in any part of your code.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Implement the bodies of all member functions and constructors in <span class="filename">PatientQueue.cpp</span>.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Here are a few other constraints we expect you to follow in your implementation:
</p>

<p>
	You should not make unnecessary passes over the linked list.
	For example, when enqueuing an element, a poor implementation would be to traverse the entire list once to count its size and to find the proper index at which to insert, and then make a second traversal to get back to that spot and add the new element.
	Do not make such multiple passes.
	Also, keep in mind that your queue class is not allowed to store an integer size member variable; you must use the presence of a null <code>next</code> pointer to figure out where the end of the list is and how long it is.
</p>

<p>
	Duplicate patient names and priorities are allowed in your queue.
	For example, the <code>upgradePatient</code> operation should affect only a single occurrence of a patient's name (the first one found).
	If there are other occurrences of that same value in the queue, a single call to <code>upgradePatient</code> shouldn't affect them all.
</p>

<p>
	You are <u>not</u> allowed to use a <code>sort</code> function or library to arrange the elements of your list, nor are you allowed to create any temporary or auxiliary data structures anywhere in your code.
	You must implement all behavior using only the one linked list of nodes as specified.
</p>

<p>
	You will need pointers for several of your implementations, but you should not use pointers-to-pointers (for example, <code>PatientNode**</code>).
	If you like, you are allowed to use a reference to a pointer (e.g. <code>PQNode*&amp;</code>).
</p>

<p>
	You should not create any more <code>PatientNode</code> objects than necessary.
	For example, if a <code>PatientQueue</code> contains 6 elements, there should be exactly 6 <code>PatientNode</code> objects in its internal linked list; no more, no less.
	You shouldn't, say, have a seventh empty "dummy" node at the front or back of the list that serves only as a marker,
	nor should you create a <code>new PatientNode</code> that is just thrown away or discarded without being used as part of the linked list.
	You can declare as many local variable pointers to <code>PatientNode</code>s as you like.
</p>

<h2 id="style">Style Details:</h2>

<p>
	As in other assignments, you should follow our <a class="popup" href="../../styleguide.shtml"><strong>Style Guide</strong></a> for information about expected coding style.
	You are also expected to follow all of the general style constraints emphasized in the Homework 1-4 specs, such as the ones about good problem decomposition, parameters, redundancy, using proper C++ idioms, and commenting.
	The following are additional points of emphasis and style contraints specific to this problem.
	(Some of these may seem overly strict or arbitrary, but we need to constrain the assignment to force you to properly practice pointers and linked lists as intended.)
</p>

<p>
	<em>Commenting:</em>
	Add descriptive comments to your .h and .cpp files.
	Both files should have top-of-file headers.
	One file should have header comments atop each member function (either the .h or .cpp; your choice).
	The .cpp file should have internal comments describing the details of each function's implementation.
</p>

<p>
	<em>Restrictions on pointers:</em>
	The whole point of this assignment is to practice pointers and linked lists.
	Therefore, do not declare or use any other <strong>collections</strong> in any part of your code; all data should be stored in your linked list of nodes.
	There are some C++ "smart pointer" libraries that manage pointers and memory automatically, allocating and freeing memory as needed; you should not use any such libraries on this assignment.
</p>

<p>
	<em>Restrictions on private member variables:</em>
	As stated previously, the only member variable (a.k.a. instance variable; private variable; field) you are allowed to have is a <code>PatientNode*</code> pointer to the front of your list.
	You may not have any other member variables.
	Do not declare an <code>int</code> for the list size.
	Do not declare members that are pointers to any other nodes in the list.
	Do not declare any collections or data structures as members.
</p>

<p>
	<em>Restrictions on modifying member function headers:</em>
	Please do not make modifications to the <code>PatientQueue</code> class's public constructor or public member functions' names, parameter types, or return types.
	Our client code should be able to call public member functions on your queue successfully without any modification.
</p>

<p>
	<em>Restrictions on creation and usage of nodes:</em>
	The only place in your code where you should be using the <code>new</code> keyword is in the <code>newPatient</code> function.
	No other members should use <code>new</code> or create new nodes under any circumstances.
	You also should not be modifying or swapping nodes' <code>name</code> values after they are added to the queue.
	In other words, you should implement all of the linked list / patient queue operations like <code>upgradePatient</code> by manipulating node pointers, not by creating entirely new nodes and not by modifying "data" of existing nodes.
</p>

<p>
	You also should not create any more <code>PatientNode</code> structures than necessary.
	For example, if the client has called <code>newPatient</code> 6 times, your code should have created exactly 6 total <code>PatientNode</code> objects; no more, no less.
	You shouldn't, say, have a seventh empty "dummy" node at the front or back of the list that serves only as a marker, and you shouldn't accidentally create a temporary node object that is lost or thrown away.
	You can declare as many local variable <em>pointers</em> to nodes as you like.
</p>

<p>
	<em>Restrictions on traversal of the list:</em>
	Any function that modifies your linked list should do so by traversing across your linked list <u>a single time</u>, not multiple times.
	For example, in functions like <code>newPatient</code>, do not make one traversal to find a node or place of interest and then a second traversal to manipulate/modify the list at that place.
	Do the entire job in a single pass.
</p>

<p>
	Do not traverse the list farther than you need to.
	That is to say, once you have found the node of interest, do not unnecessarily process the rest of the list; break/return out of code as needed once the work is done.
</p>

<p>
	<em>Avoiding memory leaks:</em>
	This item is listed under Style even though it is technically a functional requirement, because memory leakage is not usually visible while a program is running.
	To ensure that your class does not leak memory, you must delete all of the node objects in your linked list whenever data is removed or cleared from the list.
	You must also properly implement a destructor that deletes the memory used by all of the linked list nodes inside your <code>PatientQueue</code> object.
</p>

<h2 id="extrafeatures">Possible Extra Features:</h2>

<p>
	For this problem, you are welcome to implement any of the extensions from Part A of
        the assignment, or you are welcome to implement a different type of heap.
</p>
<p>
	<em>Indicating that you have done extra features:</em>
	If you complete any extra features, then in the comment heading on the top of your program, please list all extra features that you worked on and where in the code they can be found (what functions, lines, etc. so that the grader can look at their code easily).
</p>

<p>
	<em>Submitting a program with extra features:</em>
	Since we use automated testing for part of our grading process, it is important that you submit a program that conforms to the preceding spec, even if you want to do extra features.
	If your feature(s) cause your program to change the output that it produces in such a way that it no longer matches the expected sample output test cases provided, you should submit two versions of your program file:
	a first one with the standard file name without any extra features added (or with all necessary features disabled or commented out), and a second one whose file name has the suffix <span class="filename">-extra.cpp</span> with the extra features enabled.
	Please distinguish them in by explaining which is which in the comment header.
	Our turnin system saves every submission you make, so if you make multiple submissions we will be able to view all of them; your previously submitted files will not be lost or overwritten.
