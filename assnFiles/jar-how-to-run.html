<h3 id="howtorunsamplesolution" class="faqheading">"How do I run the assignment solution demos?"</h3>

<p>
	<!--
	You can run our sample solutions two ways: on your machine as a downloadable program "JAR", or in your browser as an "applet".
	We recommend trying the JAR first.
	-->
	Our assignments offer a solution 'demo' that you can run to see the program's expected behavior.
	On many machines, all you have to do is download the .jar file, then double-click it to run it.
	But on some Macs, it won't work; your operating system will say that it doesn't know how to launch the file.
	If you have that issue, download the file, go to the Downloads folder in your Finder, right-click on the file, and click Open, and then press Confirm.
</p>

<p>
	Some Mac users see a security error such as, "cs106x-life-demo.jar can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer."
	To fix this, go to System Preferences &rarr; Security &amp; Privacy.
	You will see a section about downloaded apps.
	You should see a prompt asking if you would like to allow access to our solution JAR.
	Follow the steps and then you should be able to open the demo.
	<!--
	System Preferences &rarr; Java, and whitelisting the web site <strong>https://web.stanford.edu</strong> .
	If you see this security error message, you can try to follow <a class="popup" href="http://www.java.com/en/download/help/jcp_security.xml">these instructions</a> about reducing your security restrictions for running Java applets.
	-->
</p>

<p>
	If all else fails, you could run the demo JAR from a terminal.
	Every operating system allows you to open a "terminal" or "console" window for typing raw system commands.
	Open your operating system's terminal or console window (Google if you need to learn how to do this),
	and then type:
</p>

<pre class="terminal">
cd <em>DIRECTORY_WHERE_DEMO_JAR_IS_STORED</em>
java -jar <em>JAR_FILE_NAME</em>
</pre>

<p>
	For example, on a Mac machine, if your user name is jsmith12 and you have saved a demo JAR named hw1.jar in your Documents/106a directory, you would type:
</p>

<pre class="terminal">
cd /users/jsmith12/Documents/106a
java -jar hw1.jar
</pre>

<p>
	Or on a Windows machine, if your user name is jsmith12 and you have saved a demo JAR named hw1.jar in your Documents/106a directory, you would type:
</p>

<pre class="terminal">
cd C:\users\jsmith12\Documents\106a
java -jar hw1.jar
</pre>
